:i1.Getting Started
:hp2.Getting started with DrawIt for OS/2 Warp.
:ehp2.
DrawIt is a vector oriented drawing tool written for OS/2 Warp. This chapter
gives an overview of the functionallity found in this drawing package.
:hp2.Overview
:ehp2.
In DrawIt all shapes are handled the same. For instance both a circle and square
can have different filling patterns. In this help text the different shapes are
named objects. All objects can be moved and sized when they are 
:link reftype=hd res=3400.selected
:elink.. 
:hp2.Drawing.
:ehp2.
Select from the toolbar at the left side of the window the desired shape. For
instance a circle. Move the mouse to the white drawing area. You will see that
the mouse pointer holds a small circle showing you that the program is ready for
drawing circles. Click the left mouse button and move the mouse while holding
down the button. When the mouse button is released the circle appears in its
final size. The program is now ready for the next  circle. Or when you need
another shape you simply click on another button in the toolpalette. Each button
in the toolpalette is discussed further in this chapter.
:hp2.Actions on objects.
:ehp2.
Objects can be deleted, copied, sized, moved etc. All actions can be done on one
or multiple objects at the time. Only one object is deleted when just one object
is selected and the delete key is pressed. When multiple selections are done and
the delete key is pressed, multiple objects are deleted at once.
:hp2.Deletion.
:ehp2.
When an object is selected or multiple objects are selected the object(s) can be
deleted by pressing the 
:hp2.<Delete> :ehp2.
key.
:hp2.Copying.
:ehp2.
You can make a copy of one or more objects by holding down the 
:hp2.<Ctrl> :ehp2.
key while moving the objects. Be sure you first press the 
:hp2.<Ctrl> :ehp2.
key and than start dragging the object(s). After you have released the
mousebutton you release the 
:hp2.<Ctrl> :ehp2.
key.
.br
:hp2.Stretching.
:ehp2.
When the mouse cursor is moved over the handles of the selected object the
cursor changes in a double arrow. If this is the case, the object can be
stretched by holding down the left mouse button and drag the mouse. If the mouse
button is released the object will appear in it's new size. 
:hp2.Filling patterns.
:ehp2.
All objects (except images) can be filled with different patterns. The following
image shows some of the possible filling patters which can be used. Besides
these patterns the program supports two complex filling methods, namely 
:hp2.gradient :ehp2.
and 
:hp2.fountain :ehp2.
fill.

:hp2.Colors:ehp2.
.
.br
:link reftype=hd res=3200.Click here for details on colors. 
:elink.
The color of wherein an object appears after it is drawn depends on the color
choosen in the colorpalette at the bottom of the program window. The color of an
object can be changed after it is drawn. This can be done when the program is in
select mode. Use  
:artwork  runin name='F:\DEVELOP\DLG\RESOURCE\SELECT.BMP'. this button. Select
the object which needs color changes and click on the desired color in the
colorpalette. The color of the object changes only when there is a filling
pattern set for the selected object. A hollow object does not react when
changing the filling color. So first change the filling pattern by pressing the
right mousebutton above the selected object. Select a solid filling pattern and
try again the color change. The outline color can also be changed by selecting
the color in the colorpalette with the right mouse button. Or by setting the
coloring mode in the popupmenu on interior or outline. When set to outline the
color changes with the left mousebutton. When none of the colors in the palette
meets your requirement, you can simply change it by double clicking on the color
you want to change. This will bring up a dialog which ables you to remix the
color. The color of an object can also be changed via the OS/2 color palette.

initial layer after the program is started, is 1. The first layer is the far
most layer. For example, to be sure that the half toned circles are on top of
the halftoned (half toned means transparant colored) triangles we put the 
circles in layer 2 and the trangles in layer 1.

is selected you can easily change the color by clicking on the appropriate color
in the colorpalette at the bottom of the application, or you can drop a color
from the OS/2 colorpalette on the polyline. If you double click with the left
mouse button on the polyline you get a dialog which enables you to transport the
figure to a different

For the latter you have to select the polygon (it shows the four black boxes)

'froozen'. This means you cannot select the objects which are on the other layer
than the current.
:color fc='Red' bc='default'.By default the objects on the other layers cannot
be selected, so an export of the selected area as metafile or bitmap will only
contain the active layer!!

The color sheme we used is derived from the color wheel of OS/2. If you go
within OS/2 to system setup and start up one of the color palette's you can see
the colorwheel when you double click on one of the fixed colors. The outer part
of the circle is used by drawit. So if you define a range of 360 degrees and a
starting point at zero, you see that you start in red and end in purple. So you
run around the a virtual colorwheel within drawit. The precision of the color
gradient will increase when smaller ranges are used.

Be sure that the filling menu is checked on Gradient fill. 
.br
Now every object which is drawn will be filled with the gradient you choose. 
.br
When the program is in select mode objects can get gradient fill by selecting
the object and setting the fillingpattern in the filling menu to gradient fill.
Even if the option is checked you must activate it to change the selected object
it's filling pattern! 
.br
:hp2.Suppress gradientfill. 
:ehp2.
.br
This menu option causes the program to suppress the gradient fill during drawing
on the screen. This can be handy since drawing performance increase especially
when gradient filled parts are on top of other gradient filled parts which needs
a lot of ajustments and thus causes many repaints. The gradient fill will always
be printed this option only influences the appearance on the screen.

The starting angle can be changed with the most left slider. By changing the
slider position the start angle of the text will be changed. The result can be 
seen in the window at the right of the dialog. The second slider enables you to
define the sweep angle of the text.
